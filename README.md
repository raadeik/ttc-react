# TTC Next Stop Timeline

A simple component built as part of a microsite a few years back to pull upcoming times for the next TTC bus at a particular corner downtown Toronto. Extracted and placed in the Create React App framework with very little minor modification to original code.

This was a fun collaborative project with the dev team when we first started learning React.
